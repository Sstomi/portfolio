    <h2>My Idea of Building Website</h2>
     <div class="comment1">
       <h3>Simple & Modern </h3>
       <p>Djikstra said "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability". I would
          add that simplicity is also powerful. I'm taking my inspiration from my
          experience in 書道 (calligrapy): minimalist but convey a lot of meanings
          and emotions.
          <br>Hence, as a Web designer, I consider that my mission is to use the last
          technologies and best designs to connect businesses and people, specially
           internationally, in the simplest and most powerful way.</br>

      <h3>Mobile friendly & Worldwide</h3>
      <p>In 2018, 52.2 percent of all website traffic worldwide was generated
         through mobile phones*. It means that today, providing the best experience
         for mobile users is fundamental. Moreover, the international strategy for
         the Japanese companies is relying on their digital contents. Thereby,
         I'm committed to provide to my partners the opportunity to reinforce their
         digital marketing and communication strategy by connecting with the entire
         world on any device.

         <h3>My Previous Careers</h3>
         <p>Full time mom in my previous career, I had the opportunity to become Barista.
           I really loved this job. Knowledge about café and taking care of customers by
           providing them a place to relax was very enjoyable for me.
           But I'm definitely attracted by challenges and I decided to learn web technologies
           and design tools.Connecting businesses and people by creating beautiful and easy
           to use contents is my new job. I believe that my biggest strength is my ability to
           learn. Thus, I can overcome any challenges. I'm very excited to learn new methods
          and technologies. Let's grow together!</p>

         <h3>My Skills</h3>
         <p>For the technical part, the main technologies I'm using are HTML 5 and CSS.
           Both allow to create simple but efficient contents. When the requirements
           become more complex, I'm using javascript. I'm currently improving my skills
           about this programming language and its ecosystem.
           <br>About design, I'm relying on Illustrator and Photoshop to create elegant and modern contents.</br>
